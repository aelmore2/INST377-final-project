          Inkwell has a single goal: to provide lovers of classic literature
          with a centralized location to find, track, and store information
          about their favorite books and discover new favorites as well. While
          there are several services dedicated to facilitating the
          book-searching process, most are dedicated to modern literature, and
          those that aren't tend to have outdated user interfaces that are
          clunky, unintuitive, and hard to navigate. Inkwell aims to bring
          classic literature into the 21st century by offering readers a new way
          to discover a library of books that have been loved and admired for
          years!
